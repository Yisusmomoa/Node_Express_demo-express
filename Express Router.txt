By convention, Express developper split code in different files and folders to optimized code organisation.

The first and most obvious thing to do is to split the route and the route implementation codes.


app.get('/api/products/:productID', (req, res) => {
            const id = Number(req.params.productID)
            const product = products.find(product => product.id === id)

                if (!product) {
                return res.status(404).send('Product not found')
            }
            res.json(product)
})

Router help to create a list of all your apps routes and associate them to a controller file 
that contain the implementation code.

First step is to create a file to put all our app routes. 
For exemple : /routes/products.js can contain all routes related to the product resource

And next step we will create a controller file to put all our routes implementation code. 
For exemple: /controllers/products.js
