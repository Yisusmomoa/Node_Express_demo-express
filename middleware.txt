Create your first Middleware
Let's assume we want a function to log the url address of the request every time a page is visit.

Without middleware we could have done this with code like that:

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.url)
    console.log(req.params)
    console.log(req.query)
    return res.send('About Page')
})

That will work just fine but what if we have 100 different routes? 
We cannot copy/paste those console.log() lines to every routes.

One solution is to put those logs in middleware function
const logger  = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(req.url)
    console.log(req.params)
    console.log(req.query)
    next()
}s
